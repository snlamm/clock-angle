# clock-angle
#puts the angle between the two hands of clock for any given time. 

This code takes in an argument of a string (such as '4:30'), and converts the hour and minute
parts of it into integers. The until loop prompts for a response until a valid one is given. 
Valid hour and minute integers are then passed into variables that recongfigure them into
angles. Finally, the angles are subtracted from one another (depending on which is larger)
based on size. The results are put on the terminal. 

Have a good time!
